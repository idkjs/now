Learning to use the [`Drom`](https://ocamlpro.github.io/drom/) build system for ocam/reasonml projects.

- This is a port of for starting [now.ml](https://github.com/spencerwi/now.ml) project to [reasonml](https://reasonml.github.io/) using `drom`.

It took nothing at all to compile with reason. Apparently, `drom` is aware of reason syntax files. This is a really nice addition to the options for building with reason/ocaml and might be my go to option to start a project. Thanks to the folks at [`OCamlPro`](https://github.com/OCamlPro?type=source)
